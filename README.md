# NTBC Ecological Observation Inventory Dashboard

# Introduction
As part of the BCIT GIS Advanced Diploma program I completed a project for the Nature Trust of BC (NTBC). The product I created for NTBC is called the Ecological Observation Inventory Analysis (EOIA) and it is a colletion of scripts that compile and analyze ecological observation data. The project involved gathering ecological occurrence data from publicly available sources and completing analysis on the data to create summary tables and statistics of ecological occurrence data for each NTBC conservation property. The summary tables and statistics are meant to assist and inform conservation planning at NTBC. The NTBC Ecological Observation Inventory Dashboard showcases a portion of the final outputs produced from the project. 

### Project Statement, via NTBC
With input from NTBC staff, the student will compile a spatial database of ecological occurrence data available at a provincial scale. The student will also develop processes to produce different types of summary statistic outputs for use by NTBC staff in conservation planning. It is important to ensure that the methods are well documented and repeatable, ideally confined to a model or script created using ArcGIS Model Builder or ArcPy.

### Purpose of the Dashboard
The dashboard provides visualization of, and dynamic statistics for, the "Summary by Property Acquisition Number", which is one of the summary outputs created by the EOIA. The dashboard has been designed to highlight observations of species that are on BC's Red List. Species on the Red List include any species or ecosystem that is at risk of being lost (extirpated, endangered or threatened). The dashboard clearly displays information about the species at risk that have been observed in each NTBC conservation property.
